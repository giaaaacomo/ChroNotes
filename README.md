### OVERVIEW
ChroNotes is a master thesis project by Giacomo Albani ( [@giaaaacomo](https://github.com/giaaaacomo) ), following the manuscript named "CHRONOTES: STRATIFICAZIONE TEMPORALE DELL’INFORMAZIONE NELLO SPATIAL COMPUTING" ("CHRONOTES: TEMPORAL STRATIFICATION OF INFORMATION IN THE SPATIAL COMPUTING REALM") for his degree in Interaction & Experience design at [UNIRSM Design](https://design.unirsm.sm/).
The project is thought as an implementation to the [PROXIMA XTENDIT toolkit](https://25888322.hs-sites-eu1.com/xtendit#) (by [BSD Design](https://www.bsdesign.eu/), [UNIBO ADU](https://site.unibo.it/advanceddesignunit/it) and [PROTESA](https://www.protesa.net/)), that allows advanced and multimedial note-taking and multimodal/XR fruition of the contents in industrial training in low resources scenarios.
While XTENDIT naturally allows to associate information to specific points-of-interest, ChroNotes adds the temporal dimension to the whole package, allowing for notes instancing and evolution over time, time filtering of contents in regard to internal and external updates (software/hardware/regulations), and consequentially the formation of a business-wide knowledge base. 

### DISCLAIMER - ABOUT THE FILES IN THIS REPO
Since ChroNotes is based on PROXIMA and the XTENDIT toolkit, which intellectual property belongs to the partners concurring in the project, in this repository it's been made publicly available only the original content of the ChroNotes implementation. The Figma prototype files and generally all the present content, despite being designed along the XTENDIT framework to precisely fit the PROXIMA project, have therefore been stripped down to avoid intellectual fraud.
